**Static Node and Express Web App**

This static web app is a portfolio site built to showcase a few small projects developed with javascript. The web app includes a landing page, an about page with contact information, an elevator pitch, and details about the developer.

The app utilizes server-side JavaScript, specifically Node.js and Express. A JSON file is created to store all the data about the projects, and Pug is used to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

This repo demonstrates the following tasks:

* Importing the required dependencies
* Linking the JSON with the Pug templates
* Setting up routes to handle requests
* Setting up middleware to utilize static files like CSS
* Handling errors
* Setting up a server to serve the project
